    Problem Description:

        A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of
        two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

        Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two numbers whose digit length is "n".

    Constraints:

        1 <= n <= 4

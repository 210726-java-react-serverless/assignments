    Problem Description:

        Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting
        with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

            1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

        By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the
        sum of the even-valued terms up to index "n" of the sequence.

        Constraints:

            1 < n <= 91

# Practice with Linked Lists

## Overview
For this exercise, you are tasked with writing a custom implementation
for many of the common operations found on a linked list. Some simple 
tests are already provided for you (do not change them). In addition 
to the common operations there are three methods that commonly appear 
technical interviews.

## Grading Criteria
The grade related to problem-solving with Java is based upon the 
percentage of tests that you pass.

Another grade related to Git is based upon your Git commit history.
You will need to have a clean Git history (each commit should encapsulate
a single task).


## Instructions
Have your completed code submitted to your personal branch by Monday, October 04th.
